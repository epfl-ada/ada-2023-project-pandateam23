        "We observe that actors starting to be well-recognized after 1970 have decreasingly small spans of recognition. This is due to the fact the data we have ends in 2012, this means that these actors are probably still acting after 2012 but we don't have the corresponding data. Therefore the Last Year of recognition of these actors is considered to be around 2012 as we can see in the following histogram"
